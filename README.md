Technical Content 

1. My idea was to show off a bunch of modern day html/js/css during the presentation, similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKm4JcT4U4
2. Basically I want the talk to be really accessible, since everyone knows about basic js css html, but also showcase how deep those domains can get and the cool stuff you can make as a result of that
3. Proposed list of topics:
    1. popover
    2. dialog
    3. anchor positioning
    4. colors
        1. color-mix
        2. oklch
        3. contrast-color
    5. fonts
        1. variable fonts
        2. responsive font size (aka math)
    6. masking + colorful 
        1. mouse over → shiny. not practical at all from a product development sense but it is cool to look at
    7. css only stopwatch — count
    8. intersection observer / resize observer / mutation observer
    9. growing textarea / growing input
    10. view transitions
